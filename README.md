<h1>ðŸš€ Prodigy Data Science Internship Task 01</h1> 
<h2>Visualizing the Distribution of Categorical Variable in the Dataset</h2>
<h3>About the Dataset</h3>
The <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset">World Population dataset</a> used for this task is taken from Kaggle.
<h3>ðŸ”Ž Objective</h3>
<p>Based on the task, my goal was to visualize the contributions of various countries in the global population.</p>
<h3>ðŸ”Ž Procedure</h3>
<p>Initially, I hypothesized that the continents with most countries would contribute the most in the global population.</p>
<h5>Strategy 1</h5>
<p>Accordingly, I created a bar chart to visualize the number of countries by continents.</p>
<h5>Result 1</h5>
<p>I found that Africa is the continent with most countries.</p>
<h5>Strategy 2</h5>
<p>To determine the population, I created a bar chart of the global population by the continents.</p>
<h5>Result 2</h5>
<p>Contrary to my assumption, Asia ranked first in terms of contribution to world population but the bar chart showed confidence intervals around mean values. This made me curious to analyze the error bars for the same plot. </p>
<h5>Strategy 3</h5>
<p>I created the box and whiskers plot and got two outliers/countries in Asia contributing the most in global population. To find these outliers I analyzed the Asian countries.</p>
<h5>Result 3</h5>
<p>It was found that the countries were China and India.</p>
<h3>ðŸ”Ž Use of Python Libraries For Data Visualization</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
 <li><h5>ðŸ“Š Matplotlib: </h5><p>To create plots.</p></li>
 <li><h5>ðŸ“Š Plotly: </h5><p>To create bar chart for Continents by Number of Countries and box whiskers plot to visualize the outliers.</p></li>
 <li><h5>ðŸ“Š Seaborn: </h5><p>To create bar chart for wide ranging columns without the need to calculate their mean separately.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>ðŸ”Ž Conclusion</h3>
<p>This task highlights the contributions of different countries to the global population. The visualizations I created were instrumental in deriving insights and disproving prior assumptions.</p>
